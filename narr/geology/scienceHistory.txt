La Palma has been studied since the inception of Geology as a science, due to its relative accessibility to Europeans. The volcanic landform known as a caldera was named after the "Caldera Taburiente" after the German geologist Christian Leopold von Buch adopted the term from locals during his visit in 1815. von Buch used his observations from La Palma to suggest that the Canary Islands had each been thrown up from the sea floor during catastrophic explosions, following the now discredited Theory of elevation craters.

La Palma was subsequently visited by the eminent uniformitarianist Charles Lyell in 1853. Lyell used his observations to argue that the island grew gradually through a long series of volcanic eruptions, rather than the cataclysmic upheaval implied by Leopold von Buch.

While Lyells uniformitarianist view was closer to reality than those of von Buch, more recent research shows that La Palma has also experienced it's share of catastrophic events.
