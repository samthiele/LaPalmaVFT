La Palma began forming on the sea-floor around 2 million years ago, slowly growing until it was large enough to emerge above the waves. The part of La Palma that now emerges above sea-level comprises a series of overlapping volcanoes, each separated by enormous landslides.

The oldest of these is the "seamount" complex, which forms the island's core and is exposed only at the bottom of Caldera Taburiente. This is overlain by the now largely buried Garafia Volcano, which collapsed catastrophically into the sea ~1.2 million years ago. The scar left by this enormous landslide was then filled by a new volcano, the Taburiente Volcano, which make up most of the northern and central parts of the island. 

The southern part of this volcano also collapsed into the sea in several large landslides about 560 thousand years ago.

As Taburiente had done after the Garafía collapse, the landslide scar left after Taburiente's collapse was partially filled by a new volcano - known as Behenado. However, Behenado did not grow very large before it also collapsed, sending a huge rockfall northwards into what is now Caldera Taburiente. 

Subsequent volcanism occurred further south, to form the elongate Cumbre Vieja ridge that defines the southern half of La Palma. This volcano has produced several historic eruptions, most recently in 2021.

This 2021 eruption reshaped several densely populated parts of the island’s west flank. The eruption lasted for 85 days and, sadly, resulted in significant destruction of homes, infrastructure, and agricultural land.
