Caldera Taburiente was hugely important to the pre-invasion indigenous populations of La Palma: the Guanches. Prominent peaks inside the Caldera had religious significance, while rock engravings are common along the caldera rim.

Due to it's natural walls, Caldera Taburiente was also the last stronghold of the La Palma Guanches. Chief Tanaus√∫ was able to fend off the Spanish until he was ambushed during supposed peace talks in 1493. He died while being transported to Spain as a prisoner.

Following the Spanish invasion, a thriving sugar industry emerged. This economic model exploited slave labour transported from the nearby African coast, and the rich water resources of Caldera Taburiente. The "sugar plantation" model was so successful that it was subsequently duplicated during the Spanish conquest of the Americas. 

Water also became a valuable resource, as it was needed to irrigate crops. This demand rapidly exploited the easily accessible water resources, leading to the construction of hundreds of kilometers of tunnels into La Palma's flanks to access groundwater held in the porous volcanic rocks. Water from many of these galleries can be seen emerging from Caldera Taburiente today.
