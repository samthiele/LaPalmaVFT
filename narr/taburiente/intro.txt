The collapse of the Taburiente volcano in a giant landslide 560 thousand years ago exposed the relatively weak volcanic rocks on which the volcano's summit was built.  

These weak rocks were rapidly eroded, and transported down Barranco de las Angustias to the sea. Over time, this erosion incised northwards to eventually form the large "erosion caldera" that we see today. This should not be confused with calderas elsewhere in the world, which form through large volcanic eruptions known as caldera collapses.

Today, Caldera Taburiente forms a rugged garden of waterfalls and lush vegetation walled in by kilometer-high cliffs, and provides geologists with a near uninterrupted cross-section through the top several kilometers of a volcano.
