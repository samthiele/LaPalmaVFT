## Build your own tour

This VFT was build using [RockHopper](https://github.com/samthiele/rockhopper). This combines a python package for building VFTs (see [build_vft.ipynb](https://github.com/samthiele/LaPalmaVFT/blob/main/build_vft.ipynb)) with the React (javascript) front-end used to visualise everything.

`RockHopper` is still in the early stages of development, but please reach out to me if you would like to use it to create your own VFT. So long as it is open-source too, I am happy to help ãƒ…
