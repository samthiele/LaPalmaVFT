# Mirador de la Cumbrecita

La Cumbrecita, an elevated saddle formed by junction between the Cumbre Nueva ridge, Bejenado summit and Caldera Taburiente rim offers impressive overlooks of Caldera Taburiente. 

This is near the place where Chief Tanaus√∫ was ambushed by the Spanish in 1493, finalizing the Spanish conquest of the island. 

It is also a fantastic place to observe Canary Island pine trees. This distinctive pine is endemic (only found in) the Canary Islands, and thrives in the higher-altitude regions of La Palma. It is a very hardy plant, and able to withstand droughts and fires that would kill most other pine trees. Impressively, it stores small buds in it's thick bark, allowing it to quickly re-sprout and grow new leaves after a fire.

## A volcanic mystery

Not far from La Cumbrecita is a recent landslide scar exposing a mysterious volcanic structure resembling a "lava worm". If you have any ideas how this might have formed, let me know!

![Zoom-lens photo of an unusual, "worm-like" structure crosscutting welded scoria deposits. The "drop-like" shape implies some form of downward propagation, perhaps as the lava accumulated at the head of the "worm" re-melted (the presumably still very hot) scoria below it, allowing it to "burrow" downwards. Unfortunately this outcrop is cut by a recent rockfall, and so is completely unaccessible (and dangerous to approach).](img/lavaworm.jpg)}
