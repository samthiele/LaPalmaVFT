# Hoyo Verde

Hoyo Verde, a spring at the base of cliffs on the northern side of Caldera Taburiente, lies about one kilometer below the surface of Volcàn Taburiente exposed at [Los Andenes](./#losandenes1). The outcrops here offer a rare glimpse into the inner workings of a volcano. 

![Perched above an impressive waterfall, Hoyo Verde offers a verdant oasis after a strenuous hike. It is also one of the few places where the base of the cliffs forming Caldera Taburiente can be safely approached.](img/hoyoverde.jpg)

## [Stop 1: Compacted scoria](./#hoyoverdecliffa)

The rocks forming the ~300 m high cliff above Hoyo Verde are mostly formed by pyroclastic volcanic rocks deposited during eruptions early in the life of Volcàn Taburiente. These tuffs and scoria deposits are similar to those seen previously at [Los Andenes](./#losandenes1d), but have been significantly compacted by the weight of the volcano that subsequently grew on top of them.

In this location, we can see reddish-brown compacted scoria deposits and laminated (likely phreatomagmatic) tuff deposits.

![Scoria and tuff deposits make up large parts of the lower Taburiente edifice, as exposed here at Hoyo Verde. These are densely crosscut by dykes, sills and inclined sheets.](img/hoyoVerdeScoria.jpg)
