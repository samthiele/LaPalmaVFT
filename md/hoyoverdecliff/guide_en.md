# Hoyo Verde

Hoyo Verde, a spring at the base of cliffs on the northern side of Caldera Taburiente, lies about one kilometer below [Los Andenes](./#losandenes1). The outcrops here thus offer a rare glimpse into the inner workings of a volcano.

## [Stop 1: Compacted scoria](./#hoyoverdecliffa)

The rocks forming the ~300 m high cliff above Hoyo Verde are mostly formed by pyroclastic volcanic rocks erupted early in the life of Volc√†n Taburiente. These tuffs and scoria deposits are similar to those seen previously at [Los Andenes](./#losandenes1d), but have been significantly compacted by the weight of the volcano that subsequently grew on top of them.

At this location, we can see reddish-brown compacted scoria deposits and laminated (likely phreatomagmatic) tuff layers.

A dense network of 0.5 - 2 m thick dykes can also be seen crosscutting the cliff above Hoyo Verde, providing an excellent opportunity to study the physics of dyke propagation. 

Dykes form when the pressure in a magma chamber exceeds the strength of the surrounding rocks, creating a crack (fracture) that quickly fills with magma. The pressure of this magma focuses tremendous force on the rocks in front of the fracture tip, causing them to break also and allowing the dyke to propagate upwards or, often, laterally. Eventually the dyke either reaches the surface to feed an eruption, or the pressure of the magma decreases (as the volume of the dyke increases) until the fracture can no longer propagate (and is "arrested"). At this point, the dyke typically solidifies, leaving the distinctive basalt-filled structures we see today. It is thought that most dykes do not reach the surface to feed eruptions.

Understanding the physics of dyke formation and propagation is an important part of volcanic hazard forecasting. Seismic signals produced as rocks fracture during dykes propagation can give early warning of immanent eruptions - the dyke that fed the 2021 eruption at La Palma was detected several days before the eruption started! Similarly, as dykes form the crucial pathways that feed magma to most (basaltic) eruptions, understanding the distances and directions dykes typically travel helps to constrain the distribution of volcanic risks.

The older dyke near the center of the image was not able to propagate across the stiff lava-flow unit, and was instead "arrested" at the contact. The second dyke had sufficient energy to continue across this boundary.](img/dykeArrest.jpg)

Interestingly, the dykes at Hoyo Verde appear to preferentially propagate along older dykes, forming the mesh-like network we see today. The resulting dyke bundles are called (confusingly) "multiple dykes" or "multi-dykes". 

Multi-dykes are typically interpreted to form when a dyke crosscuts a slightly older but not fully solidified (and hence weaker) intrusion. However, at this location, [geochronological studies](./todo) show that some (probably most) of the multi-dykes are formed from individual intrusions separated by many tens of thousands of years. 

Instead, it is thought that the dykes at Hoyo Verde formed a [stiff framework](./todo) that concentrated stresses induced by the weight of the overlying volcano, and so [fractured more easily](./todo) than the surrounding host rock.

Multi-dykes made from intrusions with varied compositions are called "composite intrusions". In this example, the inner felsic dyke appears to have arrested at the intersection of the two older dykes.](img/compositeDyke.jpg)
