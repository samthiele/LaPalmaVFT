# Hoyo Verde

Hoyo Verde, a spring at the base of cliffs on the northern side of Caldera Taburiente, lies about one kilometer below [Los Andenes](./#losandenes1). The outcrops here thus offer a rare glimpse into the inner workings of a volcano. 

![Perched above an impressive waterfall, Hoyo Verde offers a verdant oasis after a strenuous hike. It is one of the few places where the base of the cliffs forming Caldera Taburiente can be safely approached.](img/hoyoverde.jpg)

## [Stop 1: Compacted scoria](./#hoyoverdecliffa)

The rocks forming the ~300 m high cliff above Hoyo Verde were mostly erupted early in the life of Volcàn Taburiente. Tuff and scoria deposits are similar to those seen previously at [Los Andenes](./#losandenes1d), but have been significantly compacted by the weight of the volcano that grew on top of them.

At this location, we can see reddish-brown compacted scoria deposits and laminated (likely phreatomagmatic) tuff layers.

![Scoria and tuff deposits make up large parts of the lower Taburiente edifice, as exposed here at Hoyo Verde. These are densely crosscut by dykes, sills and inclined sheets.](img/hoyoVerdeScoria.jpg)

## [Stop 2: Anastomosing dykes](./#hoyoverdecliffb)

A dense network of 0.5 - 2 m thick [dykes and inclined sheets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dike_(geology)) crosscut the cliff above Hoyo Verde, providing an excellent opportunity to study the physics of magma movement and dyke formation. 

Dykes form when pressure in a magma chamber exceeds the strength of the surrounding rocks, creating a crack (fracture) that quickly fills with magma. Pressure from this magma focuses tremendous force on rocks in front of the fracture tip, breaking them and allowing the dyke to extend ([propagate](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFaz0blkYfs&ab_channel=ProfessorAgustGudmundsson)) upwards and/or, often, laterally. 

Eventually, dykes either reach the surface to create a volcanic eruption, or the magma pressure decreases (as the volume of the dyke increases) until the fracture can no longer propagate, leading to its "arrest". Magma filling the dyke then solidifies, leaving the distinctive basalt-filled structures we see at Hoyo Verde today. It is thought that most dykes do not reach the surface to feed eruptions.

Research on the physics of dyke formation and propagation is an important part of volcanic hazard forecasting. Seismic signals (sound waves) created when rocks are fractured by a dyke can give early warning of immanent eruptions - the dyke that fed the 2021 eruption at La Palma was detected several days before the eruption started! Understanding of the distances and directions that dykes can travel within different volcanic environments also helps map the distribution of volcanic risks, as dykes form the crucial pathways that feed magma to most (basaltic) eruptions. 

![Dykes cross-cutting cliffs along the southern rim of Caldera Taburiente. The older dyke near the center of the image was not able to break the stiff lava-flow unit, and was instead "arrested" at the contact. The second dyke had sufficient energy to continue across this boundary.](img/dykeArrest.jpg)

Interestingly, dykes at Hoyo Verde appear to preferentially propagate along older ones, forming the mesh-like network we see today. The resulting dyke bundles are called (confusingly) "multiple dykes" or "multi-dykes". 

Multi-dykes are often interpreted to form when a dyke crosscuts a slightly older but not fully solidified (and hence weaker) intrusion. However, at this location, [geochronological studies](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1029/2020JB021477) show that some (probably most) of the multi-dykes are formed from individual intrusions separated by many tens of thousands of years. 

Instead, it is thought that the dykes at Hoyo Verde formed a [stiff framework](https://www.nature.com/articles/s43247-023-01046-3) that concentrated stresses induced by the weight of the overlying volcano, and so fractured more easily than the surrounding scoria and tuff.

Multi-dykes made from intrusions with varied compositions are called "composite intrusions". Interestingly, the inner felsic dyke appears to have been stopped (arrested) at the intersection of the older dykes.](img/compositeDyke.jpg) 

## [Stop 3: Sills and inclined sheets](./#hoyoverdecliffc)

Several horizontal (to gently inclined) [sills](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sill_(geology)) can also be seen cutting the cliff above Hoyo Verde (toggle "sills" in the 3D viewer to see these more clearly). 

These sills also form as fractures, but in conditions where a horizontally sheet is formed, requiring magma pressure large enough to "lift" the weight of the overlying rocks! Sills in volcanic rocks can be difficult to distinguish from lava flows, but in this case the relatively sharp contacts suggest the observed structures are probably sills.

The upper sill can also be seen crosscutting the (relatively steeply dipping) scoria beds on the left, suggesting it may have a larger-scale geometry similar to a plate or "saucer". Larger [saucer-shaped sills](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2022JB024421) are commonly seen in other volcanic environments, and have been reproduced in physical experiments.

## [Stop 4: Basal breccia](./#hoyoverdecliffe)

The lowermost cliffs at Hoyo Verde are formed by a series of weak and unusual breccia deposits. Similar to those seen at [La Cumbrecita](./mirador), these breccias were likely formed by (or shortly after) the collapse of the older Garafía volcano ~1.2 million years ago. 

Various structures in these breccias bear witness to their violent origin, including boulder-sized rocks that have been completely shattered (but kept held together like a jig-saw by the pressure of the surrounding, fluid-like debris avalanche or landslide).

## [Stop 5: Peperite and chill margins](./#hoyoverdecliffd)

In this final stop at Hoyo Verde, we closely examine the external and internal contacts of a well exposed (and accessible) multi-dyke at Hoyo Verde. When the oldest dyke here (pictured below) intruded into the wet and likely weak breccia deposit surrounding it, the heat caused rapid boiling of the surrounding groundwater. The force of this boiling caused complex mixing between the intruded magma and finer-grained sediment (matrix) in the breccia, forming a distinctive rock-type known as [peperite](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peperite) along the dyke contact.

![Rapidly boiling groundwater caused mixing between the surrounding sediments (top left) and older dykes (lower right) intruded at Hoyo Verde, forming the pictured "peperites" as sediments (grey) were mixed with blobs of rapidly cooling magma (black) from the intrusion.](./img/peperite.jpg)

When magma is cooled really quickly, well structured minerals (crystals) do not have time to form, creating a [volcanic glass](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volcanic_glass). The contacts of the dyke pictured above, and subsequent internal intrusions forming the exposed multi-dyke bundle, are composed of a dark-black basaltic glass known as a chill margin. Internal glassy chill margins (see below) are often used to identify multi-dykes, as they indicate rapid initial cooling caused by contact between a magma and surrounding (relatively cold) host rock).

![Glassy black chill-margins formed as the edges of the younger (left) and older (right) intrusions in a multi-dyke exposed at Hoyo Verde were very quickly cooled by along their contacts with the surrounding rocks (older dykes and breccias). Internal chill margins (left) are a good way to identify multi-dykes. Also note the peperite texture formed as magma and host-rock were mixed at the external multi-dyke contact (right).](./img/chill.jpg)

## [Next site - Barranco de las Angustias](./#idafe)

We now follow the river emerging from Hoyo Verde deeper into the base of Caldera Taburiente, where it eventually cuts through the oldest rocks exposed on La Palma: the seamount complex. These outcrops provide a chance to see the submarine volcanic rocks built most of the island of La Palma (as more than two thirds of the island is below sea level!).
