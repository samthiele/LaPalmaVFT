# Los Andenes

In addition to spectacular views, the road through Los Andenes (not far from the highest point on La Palma, [Roque de los Muchachos](./#/muchachos), provides an excellent cross-section through the [scoria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scoria), [volcanic ash](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volcanic_ash) and [lava flows](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lava) that are typical near the vents of basaltic volcanoes.

These deposits will have formed along the main eruptive axis of Volcàn Taburiente, which once extended from Cumbre Nueve in the south, through the middle of Caldera Taburiente to this area on the Caldera's northern rim.

## [Stop 1 - Just below the surface](./#/losandenes1e)
---------

If we look horizontally to the south, it is evident that the layers of volcanic rocks (orange lines) that form the Los Andenes road cutting are dipping (orange disks) to the west (left) at the start of the outcrop, before flattening out and then dipping to the east (right).

The "summit" where these layers change dip is crosscut by two ~5 to 10 m thick *dykes*. [Dykes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dike_(geology)) are (now solidified) magma-filled fractures that crosscut bedding, and form the main pathway for magma to migrate to the surface from deep in the earth's crust. 

We will see a lot more dykes in this virtual field trip!

Some of the dykes around Los Andenes are quite special: their location, thickness and [complex flow and degassing structures](./#/muchachos) suggest that they once fed an eruption 10-100 m above the modern-day surface, likely shortly (geologically speaking) before the collapse of Caldera Taburiente 560 thousand years ago.

And, the cone-shaped geometry of the volcanic layers here hint that, maybe, these "feeder-dykes" provided the magma which erupted to form some of the surrounding volcanic rocks and lava flows. 

This cone-shaped pile of volcanic rocks is called a [scoria cone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cinder_cone) (or *cinder cone*), of which many can be found on La Palma - including from the most recent eruption in 2021. Los Andenes once looked very similar to this, or [Hoyo Negro](./#hoyonegro), which formed during an eruption in 1949 and created lots of similar rock formations.

## [Stop 2 - Bubbles](./#/losandenes1c)
----

The explosions that eject lava (and lava bombs!) from scoria cones are triggered by large bubbles of gas, called "slugs", that rise through the vent to violently burst near the surface during [Strombolian eruptions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strombolian_eruption). 


Some of these gas slugs were trapped as the dykes at Los Andenes solidified, forming the large elliptical voids visible today. These "frozen explosions" offer a rare insight into a volcanic eruption that happened more than 560 thousand years ago!

## [Stop 3 - Pyroclastic rocks: Tuff and scoria](./#/losandenes1d)
----

During many volcanic eruptions, smaller gas bubbles in the erupted lava pop rapidly enough to create fragments called [tephra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tephra), which are explosively ejected from the vent. The size, shape and distribution of tephra can be used to reconstruct prehistoric eruptions, and so understand the past behavior and future risks posed by volcanoes around the world.

When gas bubbles in erupting magma are large (as seen in the previous stop), the resulting Strombolian eruptions create large (cm-sized) tephra. These fragments fall quickly to the ground and, at basaltic volcanoes, accumulate near the vent to form a [scoria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scoria) cone. Scoria formed during these eruptions is often hot enough to weld together, forming "spatter" if the fragments are still quite liquid, and "welded scoria" when the fragments are less fluid. 

Scoria's high temperature means that it quickly oxidises, turning a distinctive red colour. Red welded scoria deposits are common at Los Andenes, and around the [vents](./#hoyonegro) of the the active Cumbre Vieja volcano to the south.

Many eruptions also produce smaller fragments, called [volcanic ash](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volcanic_ash) when their diameter is < 2 mm. Although more common at andesitic or rhyolitic volcanoes, eruptions at basaltic volcanoes like La Palma can also create large ash deposits (known as [tuff](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuff)) when the magma has an unusually high gas-content or interacts with water to (explosively) generate large amounts of steam. Ash particles can travel significantly further from a vent than scoria, often being blown many kilometers downwind.

Tuff beds on La Palma are typically black, due to the presence of rapidly cooled (and difficult to oxidise) [volcanic glass](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volcanic_glass), or yellow when altered. This location shows a distinctive, well bedded black ash bed (tuff), that transitions upwards into a yellow [palagonite](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palagonite) tuff. 

![Welded spatter formed by fragments of lava ejected during an eruption on Cumbre Nueva. These fragments (clasts) were molten enough to deform and flatten once they had landed, but chilled enough not to combine into a lava flow.](img/spatter.jpg)

## [Stop 4 - Lava flows downhill](./#/losandenes1b)
----

Lava flows form when lava reaches the surface without fragmenting (due to a lower gas-content or slower rate of ascent), or when erupted fragments are hot enough that they accumulate and become a liquid mass. At this site, a thick lava flow can be seen flowing downhill away from the vent, which may have been located along strike from the dyke exposed at [Stop 2](./#/losandenes1c). 

![Drone photo of the lava flow that flowed downhill from the summit of the scoria cone cut by the road at Los Andenes.](img/andenesFlow.jpg)

Lava flows can travel many kilometers, and represent one of the greatest risks to infrastructure and homes near basaltic volcanoes. 

Depending on its temperature and composition, basaltic lava tends to form two types of flow. More liquid lava creates rope-like folds as the chilled crust is bent and crumpled, to form [pahoehoe](https://volcano.oregonstate.edu/pahoehoe). Less liquid flows break into hot chunks at the flow front, base and top, forming much slower moving [A'a](https://volcano.oregonstate.edu/a039a) flows.

![A'a lava flows such as this one are common in road-cuttings around the coast of La Palma, as they travel much further from the eruptive areas than scoria does and are better preserved than basaltic ash deposits. Note the broken chunks (breccia) that define the base and top of each lava flow in this outcrop, and the solid cores formed as hotter lava flowed through the middle of the flow. This structure is typical of A'a lava flows.](img/lava.jpg)

*A'a lava flows were responsible for much of the destruction caused by the 2021 eruption on La Palma.*

## [Stop 5 - Water and fire](./#/losandenes1a)
----

The end of the Los Andenes roadcut exposes a striking yellow [palagonite](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palagonite) tuff. Palagonite is a distinctive alteration caused as [warm to hot water alters basaltic glass](https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s00531-001-0238-7.pdf) to form hydrated and oxidised clay minerals.

Palagonite commonly forms through [phreatomagmatic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phreatomagmatic_eruption) eruptions in which hot magma or lava comes into contact with surface- or ground-water to create a steam-rich volcanic plume. Interaction between between this steam and rapidly quenched and fragmented volcanic glass (ash) facilitates the relatively fast conversion of the volcanic glass to palagonite. 

![Yellow (palagonite) ash beds exposed at Los Andenes.  Note the spindle bomb on the left, formed by a spinning blob of still liquid lava that was ejected from the vent. The size of these bombs indicate the vent must have been relatively close.](img/bombs.jpg)

*Phreatomagmatic eruptions are often very explosive, and can happen with little warning*

## [Next site - Hoyo Verde](./#hoyoverdecliff)

We will now dive deeper into Volcàn Taburiente, using exposures along the cliffs of Caldera Taburiente to discover how magma moved within this volcano during its journey to the surface.
