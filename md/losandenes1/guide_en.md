# Los Andenes

In addition to spectacular views, the road through Los Andenes (not far from the highest point on La Palma, [Roque de los Muchachos](./#/muchachos) provides an excellent cross section through the scoria, volcanic ash beds and lava flows that are typical near the vents of basaltic volcanoes.

These deposits will have formed along the main eruptive axis of VolcÃ n Taburiente, which extended from Cumbre Nueve in the south, through the middle of Caldera Taburiente to this area on the Caldera's northern rim.

If we look approximately horizontally (to the south), it is evident that the layers of volcanic rocks (orange lines) that form the Los Andenes road cutting are dipping (orange disks) to the west (left) at the start of the outcrop, before flattening out and then dipping to the east (right).

The "summit" where these layers change dip is crosscut by two ~5 - 10 m thick *dykes*. Dykes are (now solidified) magma-filled fractures that crosscut bedding and are the main pathway for magma to migrate to the surface from deep in the earth's crust. We will see a lot more dykes in this virtual field trip!

These dykes, however, are quite special -- as their thickness, [complex flow and degassing structures](./#/muchachos) and location suggests that they once fed an eruption 10-100 m above the current day surface, likely shortly (geologically speaking) before the collapse of Caldera Taburiente ~560 thousand years ago.

And, the cone-shaped geometry outlined by the volcanic layers hint that, maybe, these "feeder-dykes" provided the magma that erupted to form the surrounding volcanic rocks and lava flows. 

The resulting cone-shaped pile of volcanic rocks is called a [scoria cone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cinder_cone) (or *cinder cone*), of which many can be found on La Palma - including from the most recent eruption in 2021. Los Andenes likely looked very similar to this, or [Hoyo Negro](./#hoyonegro), which formed during an eruption in 1949 and created lots of very similar rock formations.

## [Stop 2 - Bubbles](./#/losandenes1c)

The explosions that eject lava (and lava bombs!) from scoria cones are generally triggered by large bubbles of gas, known for some reason as "slugs", that rise through the vent to violently burst near the surface. 

Unusually, some of these gas slugs were trapped as the dykes at Los Andenes solidified, forming large elliptical voids.
