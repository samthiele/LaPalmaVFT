# Welcome to La Palma! 

Located in the Atlantic Ocean off the northwest coast of Africa, La Palma is the most northwesterly island of the Canary archipelago.

It is renowned for its rich biodiversity, dense laurel forests and deep ravines. The grandest of these ravines, "Caldera Taburiente", cuts it's way into the core of the island to provide spectacular exposures of shallow volcanic plumbing and stratigraphy.

This virtual field trip lets you explore some of these wonders, and see the inner workings of this dynamic *ocean island* volcano.

# Tour overview

In this tour, we will explore some geologically interesting sites on La Palma, with a particular emphasis on the shallow, magma-filled fractures (dykes and sills) that feed volcanic eruptions. Understanding these "plumbing systems" is crucial to our ability to predict future eruptions and forecast their possible timing and duration.

## [Stop 1 - Geological Overview](./index.html#/geology)

Take a birds-eye view of La Palma to learn about the main geomorphological features on La Palma and their volcanic origins, including the 2021 eruption at Tajogaite. 


## [Stop 2 - Los Andenes](./index.html#/losandenes)

Explore prehistoric eruptions near the summit of Volcàn Taburiente and the explosive moments recorded by easily accessible outcrops at Los Andenes.

## [Stop 3 - Hoyo Verde](./index.html#/hoyoverde)
Todo

Dive deeper into the volcanic plumbing of Volcàn Taburiente, and see the dykes and sills that (sometimes) transported magma to ancient eruptions.


# Geological History

La Palma is one of the youngest Canary Islands, estimated to have begun forming around 2 million years ago. It is formed through a series of overlapping volcanic edifices, including:

1. A "seamount" complex in the island's core (exposed only at the bottom of Caldera Taburiente)
2. A now largely buried Volcan Garafia, which collapsed catastrophically into the sea ~1.2 million years ago to leave long debris avalanche deposits on the sea floor.
3. The Taburiente and Cumbre Nueve volcanoes, that make up the northern and central part of the island respectively. These, especially the southern part west of the Cumbre Nueva ridge, also collapsed into the sea in one (or likely several) large landslides 560 thousand years ago.
4. The "Bejenado" volcano that grew rapidly following the Cumbre Nueva collapse before itself collapsing northwards to partially fill Caldera Taburiente.
5. Cumbre Vieja, the still active volcano that forms the elongate ridge defining the islands south.

Caldera Taburiente provides unparalleled exposure of three of these edifices; the seamount complex, Taburiente volcano (and it's south flank, Cumbre Nueve) and Bejenado. Despite being the namesake of caldera's worldwide, Caldera Taburiente did not form from the collapse of a shallow magma chamber. Rather, it represents the heavily eroded remnants of the enormous landslide scar formed (and still partially preserved along the Cumbre Nueva ridge) 560 thousand years ago.

# Recent eruptions

La Palma’s most recent eruption occurred in 2021 when the Cumbre Vieja volcano erupted after decades of dormancy, releasing lava flows that reshaped densley populated parts of the island’s west flank. The eruption lasted for 85 days, and resulted in significant destruction of homes, infrastructure, and agricultural land.
