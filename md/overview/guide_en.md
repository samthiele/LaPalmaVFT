# Welcome to La Palma! 

Located in the Atlantic Ocean off the northwest coast of Africa, La Palma is the most northwesterly island of the Canary archipelago.

It is renowned for its rich biodiversity, dense laurel forests and deep ravines. The grandest of these ravines, "Caldera Taburiente", cuts it's way into the core of the island to provide spectacular exposures of shallow volcanic plumbing and stratigraphy.

This virtual field trip lets you explore some of these wonders, and see the inner workings of this dynamic *ocean island* volcano.

*Expore La Palma's incredible landscape and geological past in this virtual field trip, from the summit of an ancient volcano through ancient eruptions and landslides to the underwater volcano that lies at the island's heart.*

# Tour overview

In this tour, we will explore some geologically interesting sites on La Palma, with a particular emphasis on the shallow, magma-filled fractures (dykes and sills) that feed volcanic eruptions. Understanding these "plumbing systems" is crucial to our ability to predict future eruptions and forecast their possible timing and duration.

## [Stop 1 - Geological Overview](./#geology)

Take a birds-eye view of La Palma to learn about the main geomorphological features on La Palma and their volcanic origins, including the 2021 eruption at Tajogaite. 

## [Stop 2 - Caldera Taburiente](./#taburiente)

Fly over the Caldera Taburiente and think about how and why this dramatic and unusual geomorphological feature formed.

## [Stop 3 - Los Andenes](./#losandenes1)

Explore prehistoric eruptions near the summit of Volcàn Taburiente and the explosive moments recorded by easily accessible outcrops at Los Andenes.

## [Stop 4 - Hoyo Verde](./#hoyoverdecliff)

Dive deeper into the volcanic plumbing of Volcàn Taburiente, and see the dykes and sills that (sometimes) transported magma to ancient eruptions.

## [Stop 5 - Barranco de las Angustias](./#/idafe)

Discover the uplifted seamount that forms the foundations of the island of La Palma, and learn about the deeper plumbing system that stores magma before eruptions.
