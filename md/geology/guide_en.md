As one of the youngest Canary Islands, La Palma has a short but dramatic geological history. 

It is thought to have become forming on the sea-floor around 2 million years ago, slowly growing until it was large enough to emerge above the waves.

## Scientific History

Due to its relative accessibility and stunning exposures, La Palma has been studied since the inception of Geology as a science.

The volcanic landform known worldwide as a "caldera" was named after the "Caldera Taburiente", after the German geologist [Christian Leopold von Buch](https://www.encyclopedia.com/science/dictionaries-thesauruses-pictures-and-press-releases/buch-christian-leopold-von) visited in 1815. von Buch used his observations from La Palma (and several other Canary Islands) to suggest that the Canary Islands had each been thrown up from the sea floor during catastrophic explosions, following the now discredited ["Theory of elevation craters"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elevation_crater).

La Palma was subsequently visited by the eminent  [uniformitarianist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uniformitarianism) [Charles Lyell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Lyell) in 1853. Lyell used his observations to [argue](https://pubs.geoscienceworld.org/gsl/books/edited-volume/1657/chapter-abstract/107471535/The-geological-travels-of-Sir-Charles-Lyell-in) that the island grew gradually through a long series of volcanic eruptions, rather than the cataclysmic upheaval implied by von Buch.   

While Lyell's uniformitarianist view was closer to reality than von Buch's, more recent research shows that La Palma has also experienced it's share of catastrophic events too.

## Volcanoes and landslides

The part of La Palma that emerges above sea-level comprises a series of overlapping volcanoes, each separated by enormous landslides.

As the above image makes clear, rocks from the following volcanic edifices are exposed at the surface:

1. The "seamount" complex, which forms the island's core (exposed only at the bottom of Caldera Taburiente).
2. A now largely buried Volcan Garafia. This collapsed catastrophically into the sea ~1.2 million years ago, to leave a landslide scar that was likely similar to the modern-day Caldera Taburiente.
3. Volcán Taburiente, which make up most of the northern and central parts of La Palma. The southern part of this volcano (west of Cumbre Neuva) also collapsed into the sea in several large landslides about 560 thousand years ago.
4. The "Bejenado" volcano, which grew rapidly following the  collapse of Volcán Taburiente, before also collapsing (northwards) to partially fill Caldera Taburiente.
5. Cumbre Vieja, the still active volcano that forms the elongate ridge defining the islands south. This has produced several historic eruptions, most recently in 2021 at Tajogaite.


## Recent eruptions

La Palma’s most recent eruption occurred in 2021 when the Cumbre Vieja volcano erupted after decades of dormancy, releasing lava flows that reshaped densley populated parts of the island’s west flank. The eruption lasted for 85 days and, sadly, resulted in significant destruction of homes, infrastructure, and agricultural land.
