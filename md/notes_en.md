## Notebook

- Use this space to jot down notes.
- Document your observations and findings.
- Record e.g., class activities or assignments.

`Double click` to edit and enter your thoughts (in markdown). 

Use `shift+enter` to finish editing.

*Don't forget to download your notes (using the button below), as they won't be saved otherwise!*

## Measurements

Any annotations[^1], including distance, and orientation measurements, will also appear in tables here. 

[^1]: Use `Ctrl-click` to add annotation points. Two points define a line (trend, plunge and distance) while three define a plane (strike, dip, dipdir). Use `Enter` to save the annotation and add it to the corresponding table (or `Esc` to cancel). See the `Help` tab for further details.
