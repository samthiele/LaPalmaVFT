The deeper valleys of Caldera Taburiente (including, most notably, Barranco de las Angustias) cut into the "seamount complex", which forms the basement to Volcán Taburiente (and the older Volcán Garafìa). 

## Submarine volcanic rocks

These rocks formed below sea level [1] before La Palma was tall enough to emerge above sea level! We know this because in places there are well preserved pillow basalts (and associated submarine breccias) that can only form when lava is erupted onto the seabed.

These formed as basaltic lava was erupted onto the sea floor, and rapidly chilled by the sea water to form elongate lobes called pillows. The crosscutting dyke may be younger, but likely fed subsequent seafloor eruptions.](/img/pillows.jpg)

Other underwater volcanic rocks exposed in the Seamount Complex include distinctive white ([trachytic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trachyte)) lavas, that were likely extruded to form large domes on the seafloor, and beds of brecciated pillow fragments that formed as fragments of forming pillows rolled downslope and accumulated.

## Sheeted dyke swarms

In many places, however, these old submarine volcanic rocks have been nearly completely intruded by dykes and sills. Many of these will have formed while the volcano was still underwater, while others will have fed the eruptions that formed Volcán Garafìa and Volcàn Taburiente. These "sheeted dyke complexes" are typical of underwater volcanoes and, incidentally, [make up a large part of the oceanic crust](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sheeted_dyke_complex).

![Dykes and sills, some of which fed magma to surface eruptions, pervasively crosscut the submarine volcanic rocks of the Seamount Complex. In places, they make up >90% of the rock volume! ](/img/sheetedDykes.jpg)

## Gabbro and deep volcanic plumbing

In other places, large intrusions formed and crystallized slowly enough for large crystals to form. These are dominated by pyroxene and plagioclase minerals, forming a rock known as [gabbro](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gabbro). Large pyroxene crystals and other gabbro fragments in dykes and lavas of Volcàn Taburiente (and other volcanoes) formed in similar (but larger) *magma chambers* at depths of 5-10 km below the summit, and represent the source of many eruptions.
