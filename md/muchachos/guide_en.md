# Roque de los Muchachos

The highest point on La Palma, Roque de los Muchachos provides spectacular overlooks of Caldera Taburiente.

It also sits above a dyke (volcanic fracture or fissure that was filled with magma that has now solidified) that shows lots of interesting evidence for a process called magma drain-back.

## Drain-back structures

Drain-back occurs when magma pressure drops rapidly at the end of an eruption, or following the opening of a new vent downhill from a previous one. In [one eruption on Hawaii in 1959](https://archive.wikiwix.com/cache/index2.php?url=https%3A%2F%2Fhvo.wr.usgs.gov%2Fkilauea%2Fhistory%2F1959Nov14%2F#federation=archive.wikiwix.com&tab=url), this drain-back was strong enough to drain 63 million cubic meters of lava from a lava lake back through the feeding dyke, forming a "lava whirlpool"!

This can leave [unfilled cavities](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00445-015-0962-7) in the dykes that feed magma to the surface during eruptions. These are abundant around Roque de los Muchachos, and include structures similar to [lava tubes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lava_tube) (but inside dykes!), as well as lots of drips (lavacles) and bubble ([vesiculated](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vesicular_texture))channels formed as the magma in the dykes flowed laterally downhill.

The distinctive layers on the dyke walls may have formed as magma stuck to the dyke wall during eruptive phases, while the blocky core appears to have formed (from partially fragmented clasts of "spatter"?) as the dyke solidified towards the end of an eruptive stage. During this stage, significant volumes of magma appear to have drained laterally from the dyke, forming a lava-tube like structure.](img/tubeDyke.jpg)

## Vents?

Some of the open cavities at Roque de los Muchachos also show distinctive vertical scour marks or scratches on the inside of the dyke walls. Could these have formed as magma fragments collided with the dyke walls during their rapid upward journey during an eruption? If so, then this dyke represents the inside of a ~560 thousand year old volcanic vent!
