# Caldera Taburiente

The collapse of Volcàn Taburiente in a giant landslide ~550 thousand years ago exposed the relatively weak volcanic rocks on which the volcano's summit was built.  

These weak rocks were rapidly eroded, and transported down Barranco de las Angustias to the sea. With time, this erosion incised northwards to eventually form the "erosion caldera" that we see today.

This mystical place, a rugged garden of waterfalls and lush vegetation walled in by km-high cliffs, provides a near uninterrupted cross-section through the top 1.5 - 2 km of the now-extinct Volcàn Taburiente.

## Historical significance

Caldera Taburiente was hugely important to the pre-invasion indigenous populations of La Palma - the [Guanches](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guanches). Prominent rocks ("Roques") inside the Caldera had religious significance, while rock engravings are common along the caldera rim.

Due to it's natural walls, Caldera Taburiente was also the last stronghold of the La Palma Guanches. Chief Tanausú was able to fend off the Spanish until he was [ambushed](https://islandmomma.wordpress.com/2014/07/16/tanausu-and-acerina-a-story-of-love-betrayal-from-la-palma/) during supposed peace talks in 1493.
