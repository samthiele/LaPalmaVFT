# Caldera Taburiente
----

> audio narr/taburiente/intro.wav

The collapse of Volcàn Taburiente in a giant landslide 560 thousand years ago exposed the relatively weak volcanic rocks on which the volcano's summit was built.  

These weak rocks were rapidly eroded, and transported down Barranco de las Angustias to the sea. With time, this erosion incised northwards to eventually form the "erosion caldera" that we see today. This should not be confused with calderas elsewhere in the world, which form through large volcanic eruptions known as caldera collapses.


Today, Caldera Taburiente forms a rugged garden of waterfalls and lush vegetation walled in by km-high cliffs, providing a near uninterrupted cross-section through the top 1.5 - 2 km of the now-extinct Volcàn Taburiente.

## Historical significance

> audio narr/taburiente/history.wav

Caldera Taburiente was hugely important to the pre-invasion indigenous populations of La Palma - the [Guanches](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guanches). Prominent rocks ("Roques") inside the Caldera had religious significance, while rock engravings are common along the caldera rim.

Due to it's natural walls, Caldera Taburiente was also the last stronghold of the La Palma Guanches. Chief Tanausú was able to fend off the Spanish until he was [ambushed](https://islandmomma.wordpress.com/2014/07/16/tanausu-and-acerina-a-story-of-love-betrayal-from-la-palma/) during supposed peace talks in 1493.

Following the Spanish invasion, a thriving sugar industry emerged on La Palma. This economic model exploited slave labour transported from the nearby African coast, and the rich water resources of Caldera Taburiente. The "sugar plantation" model was so successful that it was subsequently duplicated during the Spanish conquest of the Americas. 

Water also became a valuable resource, as it was needed to irrigate the sugar (and, more recently, banana) crops. This demand rapidly exploited the easily accessible water resources, leading to the construction of hundreds of kilometers of tunnels into La Palma's flanks to access groundwater held in the porous volcanic rocks. Water from many of these galleries can be seen emerging from Caldera Taburiente today.
